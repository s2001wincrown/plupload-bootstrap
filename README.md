Bootstrap UI for plupload
=================

plupload has a UI based on Jquery UI <a href="http://plupload.com/example_jquery_ui.php">http://plupload.com/example_jquery_ui.php</a>

But if we use Bootstrap instead of Jqery UI? So I have made this [Bootstrap UI for plupload](https://github.com/leedorian/pupload-bootstrap)

Because we are using Jquery2, supported browsers are same as [Jquery2's browser support](http://jquery.com/browser-support/)

But if we use Bootstrap v5.2.2? So I have updated this [Bootstrap UI for plupload] to Bootstrp v5.2.2 (https://github.com/s200wincrown/pupload-bootstrap)
